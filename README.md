- Zara technical test, contains several technologies that are used in several projects in one way or another.

## Technologies

- NextJS 13, so comes with the power of ReactJS!
- Redux, for the slider loader and passing data from one page to another, normally used in SPAs, its operation is shown in the slider and passing of the data.
- Uses local storage in one page, JSON stringifying and parsing the data
- TailwindsCSS and MUI, pretty components.
- Server components and Client components separation, important for a good optimization. For example, fetching all the episode list is hard, let the server handle it!

## More details

- Has 3 views, showing a list of podcast (/), one podcast internal with more details and some episodes, and the episode internal so we can listen to it. 
- URL is kept clean of any passing of the data through it.
- Has some SPA normal functionality, but with the power of some server side components, the best of both worlds!, can be complicated but, it is better for the user.
